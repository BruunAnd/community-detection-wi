## Sentiment analysis
- We noticed a significant different in the sizes of the positive and negative classes.
This may have affected the results, but with limited time we did not do anything about it.
- We chose a Naive Bayes classifier as our model, mostly due to it being simple yet yielding accurate results.
Being simple, we can train it quickly and try different approaches. We can also perform cross validation more easily.
